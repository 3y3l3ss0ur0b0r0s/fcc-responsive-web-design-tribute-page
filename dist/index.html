    <h2>Historical Context</h2>
    <p>
      <em>The colonization of the Philippines by Spain began in 1521 when it was claimed as a colony for the Spanish Empire. Opposition to Spanish rule was growing rapidly during the late 19th century, and a secret revolutionary society called "the Katipunan ("Revolution")" formed in 1892. 
        <br><br>
        By 1896, the Katipunan was 100,000 people strong. When the Spanish discovered the Katipunan, the Philippine revolution began.</em>

    <h2>Melchora Aquino's Life</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Melchora Aquino was born on January 6th, 1812</b> to a peasant couple in Caloocan. Despite never having the opportunity to attend school, she was notably literate and highly intelligent at an early age.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>In her adulthood,</b> Melchora Aquino was known as a medicine woman, and she helped her neighbors with minor ailments and injuries. She eventually married a village chief and had six children with him. When her husband passed away, she raised their children on her own, running her family farm and managing other businesses to make ends meet.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>In 1896, the Philippine revolution began</b>, and Melchora Aquino used her business as a way to help soldiers by providing both medical care and spiritual support through prayer. She also allowed her business to be used for secret meetings, eventually becoming known as <b>"Mother of the Katipunan"</b>, and eventually, <b>"Tandang Sora"</b>.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>On August 29th, 1896, Melchora was discovered and arrested by the Spaniards.</b> Although she was questioned about the leader of the Katipunan, she did not tell them anything. Because of her incompliance, she was deported to the Mariana Islands.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>In 1898, the United States took control of the Philippines</b>, and Melchora Aquino was permitted to return home.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Melchora Aquino passed away on March 2nd, 1919</b> at the age of 107.</li>
      <br>
    </ul>
